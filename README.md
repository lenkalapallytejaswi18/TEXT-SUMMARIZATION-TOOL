*DESCRIPTION* : The Smart AI Text Summarization Tool is a simple and easy-to-use web application that helps people quickly shorten long pieces of text into short and meaningful summaries. This tool is built using Python and a library called Streamlit, which allows developers to make web apps with very little code. The main purpose of this project is to save time for people who need to read or understand large articles, documents, or essays. Instead of reading the whole thing, users can copy and paste their text into the app, click a button, and get a short version of the main points within seconds. The app uses powerful machine learning models like Google’s FLAN-T5 or Facebook’s BART, which are already trained to understand and summarize human language. These models come from the Hugging Face Transformers library, which is popular for natural language processing tasks.

When a user enters the text, the tool first cleans it by removing extra spaces or new lines to make it easier for the model to read. Then, the app checks if the text is too long and cuts it to a maximum of 500 words, which helps the model give faster and better results. The app allows users to choose how short or long they want the summary to be using sliders. This gives them more control over the final output. The tool creates a special prompt like “Summarize: <text>” and sends it to the model, which reads the text and gives back a short summary. The app shows this result clearly and neatly below the input box so the user can read it easily.

Apart from the AI method, the tool also includes a second method of summarization using something called Sumy. This is a more traditional or rule-based approach that works without needing an internet connection or a large model. It uses an algorithm called LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis), which looks at the most important sentences in the text and selects a few to form the summary. This method is useful if someone wants a lightweight and fast summarizer that doesn’t rely on modern AI.

The app also handles errors well. If the user doesn’t enter any text or if something goes wrong while summarizing, it shows a warning or an error message. It also shows a spinner while the model is working, so users know the app is processing their request. This makes the app feel smooth and reliable. Overall, the Smart AI Text Summarization Tool is helpful for students, teachers, researchers, and anyone who wants to save time while reading long texts. It combines the power of modern AI and traditional methods to give users a flexible and easy solution. With a clean interface and quick results, it makes summarizing text a simple task for everyone, even if they don’t know anything about programming or artificial intelligence.
